# ModBrick

Placing modular bricks in your virtual space!

## Why
Not looking to create a general 'fun' sandbox, more of an intuitive building application.

## Goals
At minimum a means of quickly building models with modular bricks in multiplayer.
Let's get some stretch goals though.

Version 0.1:
- Bricks snap to bricks below, bricks have 'top' studs that can be 'taken'
- Bricks can also snap to the bottom of bricks, bricks have bottom 'spaces' (between tubes) that can be 'taken'
- Bricks can be rectangular, they are meshed and look like some particular popular brick design
- Different colors can be chosen for bricks

Version 0.2:
- Triangular shapes
- Arch shapes.
- Support for snapping in other rotations (0.1 just up and down)

Version 0.3:
- Introduce new VR interface, using Leap Motion for interacting with bricks.
- Saving creations fully (entire scene) or partially (as 'prefabs')

Version 0.4:
- Networked multiplayer
- Support for exporting models to GCODE.
